          <p>
            Since beginning my career as a Front End developer 5 years ago, Iâ€™ve
            picked up a number of skills building websites that are fast and
            easy to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main area of expertise is using HTML, CSS and JS to create
            interactive layouts for medium and large web apps. I build websites
            with scalability, accessibility and security in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have picked up some back end knowledge. My professional
            experience I have used PHP with code igniter but I wish to branch
            out and learn newer back end technologies, namely NodeJS which I
            started learning.
