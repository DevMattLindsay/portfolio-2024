              Set up headless CMS for documentation writers to write and publish
              content for the company website. Used Strapi for the CMS and

            <li>
              Built an Editable table component that used AWS Appsync to fetch
              live data, in so that multiple users can work on the same table

              feedback for the user. Implemented virtualization to handle large
              datasets (1000+ records) in the table without significant
              performance loss.
