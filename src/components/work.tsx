            A large scope web application that allows users to upload, edit,
            preview and order photo products. Worked on this project for 5 years

            dimensional product previews with ThreeJS. Overhauled Stylesheet
            system to a modular SCSS setup.

            Dynamically built MP4 videos on the backend using FFmpeg for newer

            Photo Product website similar to Walmart Photo Centre but made for
